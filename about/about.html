    </header>
    <section>
        <p>TypeA is my passion project, I love typing and have experienced a wide
            variety of sites which offer speed-typing contests.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to create TypeA to combine my favourite features of every site,
            for example TypeRacer is my all time favourite site, but it does not offer
            the choice to upload your own text, or harder texts with advanced punctuation.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, this is a good project for me to practice web development, I look forward
            to implementing a backend, and various APIs on the website, as well as any technologies
            that pique my interest.
